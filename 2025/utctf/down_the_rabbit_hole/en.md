I downloaded the doc in markdown `asset/UTCTF 2025 Operational Notes.md`

The link shown actually send us to GitHub

The GIST have 2 revision

This has been added then removed:

`aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWdhLm56L2ZpbGUvSEhnUjFSUkw=`

Lets decode that b64 strings: `https://mega.nz/file/HHgR1RRL`

It required a decyption key and `Admin password: Bdm@9D/]J^7@9[D(` does not work.

Searching a bit I went back on the google doc and proceed to download other format of the file and in txt `asset/UTCTF 2025 Operational Notes.txt` there is an extra-line?! What?!

`WPPVY-9YgdHlRZjIWlYWnyST4lqZiILaA_tpGt3bqVU` Which is the mega decryption key. 
So we get a zipfile password protected and `Admin password: Bdm@9D/]J^7@9[D(` was the password to it

Inside we have a git depot

Checking out that first commit (Both commit contains a different bunny image)

And... Lets start the usual stego checklist?

Nothing came out, and then I remember that strings `Coq\IP1o7hr#yyW7` in the doc (need to assemble it as each char are on a different line)

Starting with good old steghide

```bash
steghide extract -sf image.jpg 
Enter passphrase: Coq\IP1o7hr#yyW7
wrote extracted data to "emb2.txt".

cat emb2.txt 
utflag{f0ll0w1ng_th3_wh1t3_r4bb1t_:3}
```

`utflag{f0ll0w1ng_th3_wh1t3_r4bb1t_:3}`
